Custom Component for [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io).

## Microsoft Graph API Component

Component to interface with Microsoft's Graph API on your organization's tenant.
Currently only detects the authorized user's Microsoft Teams availability and activity but the possibilities are almost endless.

The Microsoft Graph integration allows Home Assistant to create sensors from various properties of your Office 365 tenant via Microsoft's Graph API. All queries are performed using the authenticated user's account and depend on the permissions granted when creating the Azure AD application.

Home Assistant authenticates with Microsoft through OAuth2. Set up your credentials by completing the steps in [Manual Configuration](#manual-configuration) and then add the integration in **Configuration -> Integrations -> Microsoft Graph**. Ensure you log in using a Microsoft account that belongs to your organization's tenant.
